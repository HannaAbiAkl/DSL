# A Web Browser For HTML + JavaScript
#
# Congratulations! You have written: 
#
#       regular expressions defining HTML tokens
#       and thus an HTML lexical analyzer
#
#       regular expressions defining JavaScript tokens
#       and thus a JavaScript lexical analyzer
#
#       a context-free grammar defining well-formed HTML 
#       and an HTML parser that makes abstract syntax trees
#
#       a context-free grammar defining well-formed JavaScript
#       and an HTML parser than makes abstract syntax trees
#
#       a recursive tree-walking interpreter for HTML
#               that calls a graphics library and a JavaScript interpreter
#
#       a recursive tree-walking interpreter for JavaScript
#               that handles statements, expressions, variables,
#               environments and functions
#
#       an optional interpreter for simplifying JavaScript
#
#       glue code that follows software design decisions to link them all
#       together
#
# Those are the major components of our web browser. This class did not
# support all of JavaScript, and you did not write the graphics library,
# but those are minor concerns. We could easily imagine adding "for loops"
# or other JavaScript syntax as needed, now that you have the base
# language.
#
# For this problem, you must submit "your favorite" webpage text that our
# web browser can handle. 
#
# The only official requirement is that your webpage text contain
# correctly-nested tags, start with <html>, and contain <script
# type="text/javascript"> somewhere inside that HTML.
#
# Beyond that, you will receive full credit for whatever you submit. Our
# web browser is not as "forgiving" as commercial browsers, but it is still
# possible to make interesting webpages with it. Use your creativity!

webpage = """
<html>
Put something here. You must include embedded JavaScript for full credit,
but beyond that, do whatever you like.
</html>
