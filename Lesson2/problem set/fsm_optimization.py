# Title: FSM Optimization
# 
# Challenge Problem: 2 Stars
#
# Lexical analyzers are implemented using finite state machines generated
# from the regular expressions of token definition rules. The performance
# of a lexical analyzer can depend on the size of the resulting finite
# state machine. If the finite state machine will be used over and over
# again (e.g., to analyze every token on every web page you visit!), we
# would like it to be as small as possible (e.g., so that your webpages
# load quickly). However, correctness is more important than speed: even
# an optimized FSM must always produce the right answer.  
#
# One way to improve the performance of a finite state machine is to make
# it smaller by removing unreachable states. If such states are removed,
# the resulting FSM takes up less memory, which may make it load faster or
# fit better in a storage-constrained mobile device.
#
# For this assignment, you will write a procedure nfsmtrim that removes
# "dead" states from a non-deterministic finite state machine. A state is
# (transitively) "dead" if it is non-accepting and only non-accepting
# states are reachable from it. Such states are also called "trap" states:
# once entered, there is no escape. In this example FSM for r"a*" ...
#
# edges = { (1,'a') : [1] ,
#           (1,'b') : [2] ,
#           (2,'b') : [3] ,
#           (3,'b') : [4] } 
# accepting = [ 1 ] 
# 
# ... states 2, 3 and 4 are "dead": although you can transition from 1->2,
# 2->3 and 3->4 on "b", you are doomed to rejection if you do so. 
#
# You may assume that the starting state is always state 1. Your procedure
# nfsmtrim(edges,accepting) should return a tuple (new_edges,new_accepting)
# corresponding to a FSM that accepts exactly the same strings as the input
# FSM but that has all dead states removed. 
#
# Hint 1: This problem is tricky. Do not get discouraged. 
#
# Hint 2: Think back to the nfsmaccepts() procedure from the "Reading
# Machine Minds" homework problem in Unit 1. You are welcome to reuse your
# code (or the solution we went over) to that problem. 
#
# Hint 3: Gather up all of the states in the input machine. Filter down
# to just those states that are "live". new_edges will then be just like
# edges, but including only those transitions that involve live states.
# new_accepting will be just like accepting, but including only those live
# states.
