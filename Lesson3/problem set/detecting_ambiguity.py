# Detecting Ambiguity 
#
# A grammar is ambiguous if there exists a string in the language of that
# grammar that has two (or more) parse trees. Equivalently, a grammar is
# ambiguous if there are two (or more) different sequences of rewrite rules
# that arrive at the same final string.
#
# Ambiguity is a critical concept in natural languages and in programming
# languages. If we are not careful, our formal grammars for languages like
# JavaScript will have ambiguity. 
#
# In this problem you will write a procedure isambig(grammar,start,tokens)
# that takes as input a grammar with a finite number of possible
# derivations and a string and returns True (the value True, not the string
# "True") if those tokens demonstrate that the grammar is ambiguous
# starting from that start symbol (i.e., because two different sequences of
# rewrite rules can arrive at those tokens). 
#
# For example: 
#
# grammar1 = [                  # Rule Number
#       ("S", [ "P", ] ),       # 0
#       ("S", [ "a", "Q", ]) ,  # 1
#       ("P", [ "a", "T"]),     # 2
#       ("P", [ "c" ]),         # 3
#       ("Q", [ "b" ]),         # 4
#       ("T", [ "b" ]),         # 5
#       ] 
#
# In this grammar, the tokens ["a", "b"] do demonstrate that the
# grammar is ambiguous because there are two difference sequences of
# rewrite rules to obtain them:  
#
#       S  --0->  P  --2->  a T  --5->  a b 
#
#       S  --1->  a Q  --4->  a b 
#
# (I have written the number of the rule used inside the arrow for
# clarity.) The two sequences are [0,2,5] and [1,4]. 
#
# However, the tokens ["c"] do _not_ demonstrate that the grammar is
# ambiguous, because there is only one derivation for it:
#
#       S  --0->  P  --3->  c
#
# So even though the grammar is ambiguous, the tokens ["c"] do not
# demonstrate that: there is only one sequence [0,3]. 
#
# Important Assumption: In this problem the grammar given to you will
# always have a finite number of possible derivations. So only a
# finite set of strings will be in the language of the grammar. (You could
# test this with something like cfginfinite, so we'll just assume it.) 
#
# Hint 1: Consider something like "expand" from the end of the Unit, but
# instead of just enumerating utterances, enumerate (utterance,derivation)
# pairs. For a derivation, you might use a list of the rule indexes as we
# did in the example above. 
#
# Hint 2: Because the grammar has only a finite number of derivations, you
# can just keep enumerating new (utterance,derivation) pairs until you 
# cannot find any that are not already enumerated.

        for rule_index in range(len(grammar)): # for each rule
            rule = grammar[rule_index]
            if tokens[token_pos] == rule[0]: # token is on left hand side of rule
                yield ((tokens[0:token_pos] + rule[1] + tokens[token_pos+1:]), derivation + [rule_index])
