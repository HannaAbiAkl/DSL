# Writing Closure

# We are currently looking at chart[i] and we see x => ab . cd from j

# Write the Python procedure, closure, that takes five parameters:

#   grammar: the grammar using the previously described structure
#   i: a number representing the chart state that we are currently looking at
#   x: a single nonterminal
#   ab and cd: lists of many things

# The closure function should return all the new parsing states that we want to
# add to chart position i

# Hint: This is tricky. If you are stuck, do a list comphrension over the grammar rules.

def closure (grammar, i, x, ab, cd):
    next_states = [(rule[0], [], rule[1], i) for rule in grammar if (cd != [] and rule[0] == cd[0])]
    return next_states

    ("exp", ["(", "exp", ")"]),

    ("t",["I","like","t"]),
    ("t",[""])
    ]
