# Writing Shift

# We are currently looking at chart[i] and we see x => ab . cd from j. The input is tokens.

# Your procedure, shift, should either return None, at which point there is
# nothing to do or will return a single new parsing state that presumably
# involved shifting over the c if c matches the ith token.

def shift (tokens, i, x, ab, cd, j):
    if cd != [] and tokens[i] == cd[0]:
        return (x, ab + [cd[0]], cd[1:], j)
    else:
        return None
