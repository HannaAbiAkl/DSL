# Probing the Unknown
#
# Focus: Units 5 and 6: Interpreting and Debugging 
#
#
# In software engineering it is common to "break" software when changing
# it. This often results in an "old, good" version of the program and a
# "new, buggy" version of the program. In this question you have two
# versions of a JavaScript interpreter (the same one we wrote in class, in
# fact!) -- one of which is buggy. You need to find the best description
# of the bug that you can. However, for the purposes of this problem, you
# cannot see either version of the interpreter code -- you can only run
# them on inputs (i.e., probe them) and compare the results. 
#
# Pass JavaScript programs (using the simple subset of JavaScript we handle
# in class) to probe(). Programs that cause the good interpreter and the
# buggy interpreter to return different results are illuminating. Try to
# find as many of them as you can until you are certain about what the bug
# is.
#
# Once you are certain of the bug, uncomment _exactly one_ of the "bug =
# ..." lines and submit.

# This probe JavaScript string is intentionally long, but it does cause the
# good interpreter and the buggy interpreter to produce incorrect output.
# One way to approach this problem is to simplify the probe JavaScript 
# to test various hypotheses you have about what the bug could be.

# Uncomment _exactly one_ "bug = X" line below. If multiple explanations
# seem to fit, use probes to narrow it down. 

# If you think the bug is that if-then-else conditionals are mistakently
# swapped, so that the else branch is evaluated when the then branch should
# be, and vice-versa, uncomment "bug = 1". 
# bug = 1

# If you think the bug is that while loop bodies are evaluated the wrong
# number of times, uncomment "bug = 2".  
# bug = 2

# If you think the bug is that return statements do not cause methods to
# exit immediately, uncomment "bug = 3".  
# bug = 3

# If you think the bug is that "not" expressions are not evaluated
# correctly, uncomment "bug = 4". 
# bug = 4

# If you think the bug is that "&&" and/or "||" expressions are not
# evaluated correctly, uncomment "bug = 5". 
# bug = 5

# If you think the bug is that "var" statements do not correctly assign
# values to local variables, uncomment "bug = 6". 
# bug = 6

# If you think the bug is that "function" call expressions do not 
# evaluate their bodies in the correct environment, uncomment "bug =
# 7".

# If you think the bug is that "function" call expressions evaluate their
# arguments in the wrong order, uncomment "bug = 8".

# Remember, you should uncomment _exactly one_ "bug = X" line.
