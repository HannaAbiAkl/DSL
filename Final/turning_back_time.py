# Turning Back Time

# Focus: Units 1, 2 and 3: Finite State Machines and List Comprehensions
#
#
# For every regular language, there is another regular language that all of
# the strings in that language, but reversed. For example, if you have a
# regular language that accepts "Dracula", "Was" and "Here", there is also
# another regular language that accepts exactly "alucarD", "saW" and
# "ereH". We can imagine that this "backwards" language is accepted by a
# "backwards" finite state machine.
#
# In this problem you will construct that "backwards" finite state machine. 
# Given a non-deterministic finite state machine, you will write a
# procedure reverse() that returns a new non-deterministic finite state
# machine that accepts all of the strings in the first one, but with their
# letters in reverse order. 
#
# We will use same the "edges" encoding from class, but we
# will make the start and accepting state explicit.  For example, the
# regular expression r"a(?:bx|by)+c" might be encoded like this:

edges = { (1,'a') : [2],
          (2,'b') : [3,4],
          (3,'x') : [5],
          (4,'y') : [5],
          (5,'b') : [3,4], 
          (5,'c') : [6],
          } 
accepting = 6 
start = 1 

# For this problem we will restrict attention to non-deterministic finite
# state machines that have a single start state and a single accepting
# state. Similarly, we will not consider epsilon transitions.
#
# For the example above, since the original NFSM accepts "abxc", the NFSM
# you produce must accept "cxba". Similarly, since the original accepts
# "abxbyc", the NFSM you produce must accept "cybxba", and so on. 
#
# Your procedure "reverse(edges,accepting,start)" should return a tuple
# (new_edges,new_accepting,new_start) that defines a new non-deterministic
# finite state machine that accepts every string in the language of the
# original ... reversed! 
#
# Vague Hint: Draw a picture, and then draw all the arrows backwards.

    # write your code here ...

    new_accepting = start

# this is the final exam, you will definitely want to add your own tests.
