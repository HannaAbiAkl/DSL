# Discerning the Grammar 
# Challenge Problem 
#
# Focus: Units 3 and 4: Parsing and Memoization
#
#
# In this problem you are provided with the final chart that results from 
# applying the parsing algorithm from class (i.e., Earley's algorithm) 
# to a particular string of tokens. 
#
# Your task is to reverse-engineering the simplest grammar that would yield
# exactly the chart given. 
#
# You should encode your answer using the grammar format from class. Assign
# your answer to a variable named "grammar".
#
# For example, if you think the answer is
#
#       S -> T
#       T -> p Q r
#       T -> p Q s
#       Q -> q 
#
# Then you would write 
#
#   grammar = [
#     ("S", ["T"]),
#     ("T", ["p","Q","r"]),
#     ("T", ["p","Q","s"]),
#     ("Q", ["q"]),
#   ]
#
# The actual input string of tokens is:
#
# ["id", "(", "(", "id", ")", ",", "id", ")"]
#
# That string was in the language of the grammar (i.e., the parse succeeded). 
# 
# The actual resulting chart was:  
#       (Hint: although this output looks long, a correct answer from you
#       will only use about a dozen lines.)
