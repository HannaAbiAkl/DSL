# Higher-Order Functions
#
# Back in Unit 3 we introduced Python List Comprehensions -- a concise
# syntax for specifying a new list in terms of a transformation of an old
# one.
#
# For exmaple:
#
# numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
# odds = [n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 1] 
# squares = [n * n for n in numbers] 
#
# That code assigns [1,3,5] to odds and [1,4,9,16,25] to squares. The first
# operation is sometimes called "filter" (because we are filtering out
# unwanted elements) and the second operation is sometimes called "map"
# (because we are mapping, or transforming, all of the elements in a list). 
#
# Python also has functions behave similarly: 
#
# odds = filter(lambda n : n % 2 == 1, numbers) 
# squares = map(lambda n : n * n, numbers) 
#
# The filter() and map() definitions for odds and squares produce the same
# results as the list comprehension approaches. In other words, we can
# define (or implement) list comprehensions in terms of map and filter. 
#
# In this exercise we take that notion one step beyond, by making
# specialized maps and filters. For example, suppose that we know that we
# will be filtering many lists down to only their odd elements. Then we
# might want something like this:
#
# filter_odds = filter_maker(lambda n : n % 2 == 1)
# odds = filter_odds(numbers) 
#
# In this example, "filter_maker()" is a function that takes a function as
# an argument and returns a function as its result. We say that
# filter_maker is a *higher order function*. 
#
# Complete the code below with definitions for filter_maker() and
# map_maker(). 
#
# Hint: You can use either "lambda" or nested Python function definitions.
# Both will work. The function you return from filter_maker(f) will have to
# reference f, so you'll want to think about nested environments.

# Solution 1: use lambda
def filter_maker(f):
	return lambda l: [elt for elt in l if f(elt)]

def map_maker(f):
	return lambda l: [f(elt) for elt in l]

# # Solution 2: define function
# def filter_maker(f):
# 	def your_filter(lst):
# 		return filter(f, lst)
# 	return your_filter

# def map_maker(f):
# 	def your_map(lst):
# 		return map(f, lst)
# 	return your_map


# We have included a few test cases. You will likely want to add your own.
