# CHALLENGE: Automatic Debugging
#
# A key part of debugging is minimizing test cases to localize defects. We
# want the smallest test case possible that is still "interesting". For
# example, suppose we start with a too-big JavaScript test case:
#
#       var x = 1;
#       var y = 2;
#       var z = 3;
#       x = y + z; 
#       y = z; 
#       z = x + x; 
#
# And further suppose that the bug in question triggers on any addition
# involving defined variables. In that case, both of these two smaller test
# cases are also "interesting": 
#
#       var x = 1;
#       var y = 2;
#       var z = 3;
#       x = y + z; 
#
# And:
#
#       var x = 1;
#       var z = 3;
#       z = x + x; 
#
# We want to find the smallest test case we can that still shows the bug
# (i.e., is still "interesting"). One way to do this is to manually remove
# lines and check to see if the result is still interesting. But that is
# time consuming! Why don't we just write a program to do that for us? 
#
# We'll represent a test case as a list. For example, our test case above
# might be: 
#
test1 = [ ("var","x"),                  # var x 
          ("var","y"),                  # var y 
          ("var","z"),                  # var z 
          ("add",["x","y","z"]),        # x = y + z
          ("set",["y","z"]),            # y = z 
          ("add",["z","x","x"]), ]      # z = x + x 
#
# To see if a test case is still "interesting", we would run our program on
# it and look for errors or crashes or whatnot. We'll abstract that by
# assuming that we have a function call interesting(test) that takes as
# input a test case and returns true if it is interesting. For example:
#
def interesting1(test):
    # The test is interesting if it contains "A + B" on some line
    # and "var A" and "var B" _before_ that line. Let's hack something
    # up that simulates that. 
    for i in range(len(test)):
        line = test[i] 
        if line[0] == "add":
            if line[1] == [x for x in line[1] if \
                ("var",x) in test[:i]]:
                return True 
    return False 
#
# Your task is to write a function autodebug(test,interesting). It returns a
# smallest subset (sublist) of test such that that subset is makes
# interesting returns true. "Smallest" is measured by list length. 
# You may assume that that input test is interesting. 
# 
# Hint: Compose "find all subsets" with "find max". 

def all_subsets(lst):
    pset = [[]]
    for elem in lst:
        pset += [x + [elem] for x in pset]
    return pset

def autodebug(test, interesting): 
    # find the smallest subset of test that is still interesting!
    if not interesting(test):
        return None
    # your code here ...
    best_size = len(test)
    best_test = test
    for smaller in all_subsets(test):
        if len(smaller) < best_size and interesting(smaller):
            best_size = len(smaller)
            best_test = smaller
    return best_test

# We have written a few test cases. You may want to include others, but
# keep them small to spare our servers. 

print(autodebug(test1, interesting1) == \
        [('var', 'x'), 
         ('var', 'z'), 
         ('add', ['z', 'x', 'x'])])

def interesting2(lst):
        # For this one, a list is interesting if it contains three numbers
        # in strict ascending order. 
    for i in range(len(lst)):
