# JavaScript's Big Bang
#
# In class we saw one way to integrate our HTML Interpreter and our
# JavaScript interpreter to make a web browser. Our JavaScript interpreter
# returned a string, which was then rendered unchanged on the webpage.
#
# In practice, however, JavaScript output may include HTML tags and should
# be lexed, parsed and interpreted again. For example, on modern web
# browsers the following webpage ...
#
# <html>
# <script type="text/javascript">
# document.write("Tags in <i>my</i> output should be processed.");
# </script>
# </html>
#
# Does not output the literal string "Tags in <i>my</i> output should be
# processed." Instead, the <i> tags are lexed, parsed and interpreted
# again, and the web page contains "Tags in my output should be processed."
# with the word "my" drawn in italics. 
#
# This sort of recursive dependence -- in which intepreted HTML contains
# JavaScript which runs and creates new HTML which is then interpreted,
# and so on, is the heart of JavaScript's power. You can visualize it like
# a snake eating its own tail: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros 
#
# In this assignment you will extend our web browser so that the string 
# produced by JavaScript is not merely passed to the graphics library as a
# word, but is instead lexed, parsed and interpreted as HTML. (For the
# purposes of this assignment, if JavaScript creates HTML, it must created
# only well-balanced tags.) 
#
# Below is the top-level HTML Interpreter code for the web browser. You
# will not need to change any lexer definitions, token definitions, or
# anything about the JavaScript interpreter. 
#
# Hint: The required extension can be made by changin as few as three lines
# (because you already know so much about this topic)! It does require you
# to understand how lexers, parser and interpreters all fit together.
