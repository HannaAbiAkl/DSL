# The Living and the Dead
#
# In addition to optimizing expressions, it is also possible to optimize
# statements. There are many ways to do so, and we will explore one in this
# problem. 
#
# (This problem description looks long, but that is mostly because it
# contains a few worked examples.) 
#
# Consider this JavaScript fragment: 
#
#       function myfun(a,b,c,d) {
#               a = 1;
#               b = 2;
#               c = 3;
#               d = 4; 
#               a = 5;
#               d = c + b;
#               return (a + d);
#       } 
#
# Many of the assignment statements end up computing values that are never
# used. The output of the function only really depends on the final values
# of a and d. This function, with two of the lines removed, computes the
# same answer: 
#
#       function myfun(a,b,c,d) {
#               # a = 1;
#               b = 2;
#               c = 3;
#               # d = 4; 
#               a = 5;
#               d = c + b;
#               return (a + d);
#       } 
#
# Those lines can be safely removed because they do not compute a value
# that is used later. We say that a variable is LIVE if the value it holds
# may be needed in the future. More formally, a variable is LIVE if its
# value may be read before the next time it is overwritten. Whether or not
# a variable is LIVE depends on where you are looking in the program, so
# most formally we say a variable is live at some point P if it may be read
# before being overwritten after P. 
#
# We can compute the set of live variables by looking at the statements in
# the function in reverse order. 
#
#               return (a + d);
#
# Since the output of the function depends on (a + d), a and d are both
# live right before this statement. Now we consider one more statement: 
#
#               d = c + b;
#               return (a + d);
# 
# "a" and "d" were live going in to the return statement. What is live
# before "d = c + b"? Well, since "d" is overwritten, we have to remove it
# from the set. But since "c" and "b" are written, we have to add them to
# the set. So the set of live variables before that assignment statement is
# "a", "b", "c". In fact, we could annotate the whole program: 
#
#       function myfun(a,b,c,d) {
#               a = 1;
#               # LIVE: nothing 
#               b = 2;
#               # LIVE: b 
#               c = 3;
#               # LIVE: c, b
#               d = 4; 
#               # LIVE: c, b 
#               a = 5;
#               # LIVE: a, c, b 
#               d = c + b;
#               # LIVE: a, d
#               return (a + d);
#       } 
#
# Once we know which variables are LIVE, we can now remove assignments to
# variables that will never be read later. Such assignments are called DEAD
# code. Formally, given an assignment statement "X = ...", if "X" is not
# live after that statement, the whole statement can be removed. 
#
# Note that remove some dead code may make it possible to remove more
# later. For example, in this fragment:
#
#               a = 1;
#               b = a + 1;
#               c = 2;
#               return c; 
#
# We can initially find the following LIVE variables: 
#
#               a = 1;
#               # LIVE: a
#               b = a + 1;
#               # LIVE: nothing
#               c = 2;
#               # LIVE: c
#               return c; 
#
# But if we remove the "b = a + 1" assignment and repeat the process, we
# will be able to remove the "a = 1" code as well!
#
# In this assignment, you will write an optimizer that removes dead code. 
# For simplicity, we will only consider sequences of assignment statements
# (once we can optimize those, we could weave together a bigger optimizer
# that handles both branches of if statements, and so on, but we'll just do
# simple lists of assignments for now). 
#
# We will encode JavaScript fragments as lists of tuples. For example,
#
#               a = 1;
#               b = a + 1;
#               c = 2;
#
# Will be encoded as:
#
fragment2 = [ ("a", ["1"] ) ,           # a = 1
              ("b", ["a", "1"] ),       # b = a operation 1
              ("c", ["2"] ), ]          # c = 2 
# 
# That is, each assignment "LHS = RHS op RHS op RHS ..." will just be
# encoded as (LHS, [RHS, RHS, RHS]). A block is then a list of such
# assignments. 
#
# Write a procedure removedead(fragment,returned). "fragment" is encoded
# as above. "returned" is a list of variables returned at the end of the
# fragment (and thus LIVE at the end of it). 
#
# Hint 1: One way to reverse a list is [::-1] 
# >>> [1,2,3][::-1]
# [3, 2, 1]
#
# Hint 2: One "functional programming" way to make a new list that is just
# like L but with all copies of X removed is:
# [ e for e in L if e != X ] 
#
# Hint 3: Remember that if anything changes, you should call yourself
# recursively because you may find even more dead code!  

def removedead(fragment,returned): 
        # fill in your answer here (can be done in about a dozen lines)

    new_fragment = []
