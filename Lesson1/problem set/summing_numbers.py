# Title: Summing Numbers

# Write a procedure called sumnums(). Your procedure must accept as input a
# single string. Your procedure must output an integer equal to the sum of
# all integer numbers (one or more digits in sequence) within that string.
# If there are no decimal numbers in the input string, your procedure must
# return the integer 0. The input string will not contain any negative integers.
#
# Example Input: "hello 2 all of you 44"
# Example Output: 46
#
# Hint: int("44") == 44

def sumnums(sentence): 
# write your code here
    integers = re.findall("[0-9]+", sentence)
    integers = [int(x) for x in integers]
    return sum(integers) if integers else 0
         

# This problem includes an example test case to help you tell if you are on
# the right track. You may want to make your own additional tests as well.
