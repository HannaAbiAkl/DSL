# Singly-Hyphenated Words

# We examined hyphenated words in a quiz in class. In this problem you
# will get a chance to handle them correctly. 
# 
# Assign to the variable regexp a Python regular expression that matches 
# both words (with letters a-z) and also singly-hyphenated words. If you 
# use grouping, you must use (?: and ) as your regular expression
# parentheses. 
#
# Examples: 
#
# regexp exactly matches "astronomy"  
# regexp exactly matches "near-infrared"  
# regexp exactly matches "x-ray"  
# regexp does not exactly match "-tricky" 
# regexp does not exactly match "tricky-" 
# regexp does not exactly match "large - scale" 
# regexp does not exactly match "gamma-ray-burst" 
# regexp does not exactly match "" 

# Your regular expression only needs to handle lowercase strings.

# In Python regular expressions, r"A|B" checks A first and then B - it 
# does not follow the maximal munch rule. Thus, you may want to check 
# for doubly-hyphenated words first and then non-hyphenated words.


import re

regexp = r"(?:[a-z]+-[a-z]+)|(?:[a-z]+)" # you should replace this with your regular expression

# This problem includes an example test case to help you tell if you are on
# the right track. You may want to make your own additional tests as well.
